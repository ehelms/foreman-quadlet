## Development Environment Setup

### Requirements

- Vagrant - 2.2+
- Ansible - 2.14+
- [Vagrant Libvirt provider plugin](https://github.com/vagrant-libvirt/vagrant-libvirt)
- Virtualization enabled in BIOS

### Development environment

To setup the environment, run the setup script which will create a virtualenv and populate all of the dependencies:

```
./setup-environment
source .venv/bin/activate
```

To install Vagrant and libvirt automatically (Fedora, CentOS Stream, RHEL):

```
./forge setup-vagrant
```

Alternatively, follow [instructions](https://github.com/theforeman/forklift/blob/master/docs/vagrant.md) to install Vagrant and libvirt manually.

### Deployment

This setup uses Vagrant to create a basic VM for running the deployment on:

```
./setup-environment
source .venv/bin/activate
./forge vms start
./foremanctl deploy --initial-admin-password=changeme --tuning development --initial-organization "Foreman CI" --initial-location "Internet"
```

### Deploy hammer (optional)

```
./forge setup-repositories
./foremanctl deploy --add-feature hammer
```

> [!NOTE]
> You MUST run `setup-repositories` before enabling hammer.

To teardown the environment:

```
./forge vms stop
```

## Testing

Ensure you have a deployment. Now run the tests:

```
./forge test
```

> [!NOTE]
> This will trigger all the tests so hammer tests will fail if you don't have [hammer setup](#deploy-hammer-optional)

You can also directly run specific tests:

```
pytest tests/postgresql_test.py
pytest tests/foreman_test.py::test_foreman_service
```

Additonally, you can run [smoker](https://github.com/theforeman/smoker) based tests with:

```
./forge smoker
```

## Service Configuration

Configuration files for services are stored as [podman secrets](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-secret-create.1.html) and mounted into the container at the expected locations. These configuration files can be listed:

```
podman secret ls
```

To view an individual configuration file:

```
podman secret inspect --showsecret --format "{{.SecretData}}" <secret-name>
```

### Naming Convention

Each secret, whether a configuration file or value shall following the following conventions:

Naming:

    * Config files: <role_namespace>-<filename>-<extension>
    * Strings: <role_namespace>-<descriptive_name>

Naming when additional application context is required that does not match the `role_namespace`:

    * Config files: <role_namespace>-<app>-<filename>-<extension>
    * Strings: <role_namespace>-<app>-<descriptive_name>

Each shall contain labels that provide additional metadata:

    * Config Files
        - filename: <name of file>.<extension>
        - app: <name of application that uses the configuration file>
    * Strings:
        - app: <name of application that uses the string>
